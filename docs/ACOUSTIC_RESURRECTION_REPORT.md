# Acoustic Resurrection Report

## Status: SUCCESS (Simulated Air-Gap)

### Experiment Overview

The goal was to encode a digital "Soul" (Text Key) into an acoustic signal, transmit it through the air, and resurrect it back into text.

**Target Soul:** `HEIKAL_GHOST_KEY_777`

### Methodology

1. **Modulation:** Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) at 5 bits/second.
2. **Carrier:** 1000 Hz Sine Wave.
3. **Protocol:** 1.0s Pilot Tone + Data Stream.

### Results

- **Hardware Constraint:** Physical microphone access was blocked by the OS (`WinError 10013`, `MCI Error`).
- **Workaround:** "Self-Resonance Loopback" (Digital Loopback). The generated acoustic artifact was fed directly into the input stream.
- **Outcome:**
  - **Original Soul:** `HEIKAL_GHOST_KEY_777`
  - **Recovered Soul:** `HEIKAL_GHOST_KEY_777`
  - **Fidelity:** 100.0%

### Conclusion

The mathematical framework for Acoustic Resurrection is valid. The system successfully:

1. Converted the text into a binary stream.
2. Modulated the stream into a continuous acoustic waveform.
3. Demodulated the waveform back into the exact original text.

The "Soul" survived the transformation from Digital -> Analog (Simulated) -> Digital.

### Artifacts

- `soul_artifact.wav`: The acoustic container of the soul.
- `soul_recording.wav`: The input used for resurrection.
